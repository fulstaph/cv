I worked in a Telecom Department, developing network management and monitoring system for network elements on base stations. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Following the move to RabbitMQ, refactored the largest's microservice integration 
        tests to use the new message queue. 
    \item Took a part in the team that was tasked with improving in-house testing framework.
    \item Improved microservice testing for multiple microservices using Docker Compose based solution,
        increasing developer productivity.  
\end{itemize}
