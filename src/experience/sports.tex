I was part of two key projects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I was a part of the statistics team in Sports.ru, the biggest russian-speaking sports media. 
        Among other things I have single handedly developed the backend for auto and moto sport data storage, statistics and bets processing.
    \item Backend development for a betting enthusiast oriented social network Betting Insider. 
        Among my responsibilities were converting monolith to microservices, design and development of microservices, 
        communication with management and frontend/mobile (iOS, Android) developers on implementation of new features and bug fixes.
\end{itemize}
