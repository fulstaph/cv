I was part of two key projects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I was a part of the statistics team in Sports.ru, the biggest russian-speaking sports media. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Expanded the statistics database by adding new sports statistics providers.
            \item Parsed statistics from various sources and integrated it into the database.
            \item Singlehandedly added new backend microservices for automotosport statistics 
                    support with CI/CD pipelines/monitoring and exposed GraphQL API for web and mobile clients. 
            \item Built new microservice to display providers logos and banners on match pages which 
                increased company's revenue.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Backend development for a betting enthusiast oriented social network - Betting Insider. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Broke down the monolith's user authentication functionality into a microservice.
            \item Used APM tracing to improve SQL queries performance.
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize}
