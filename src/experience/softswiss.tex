I worked on a back office application used for management of online casinos. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Used profiling and tracing to improve performance of the system most used queries.
    \item Initiated the codebase's refactor using newly introduced Go's Generics feature to improve 
            code quality and readability. 
    \item Developed a new feature to handle large reports export requests for clients which reduced developers' 
            time spent on manual data export by 50\%. 
\end{itemize}
